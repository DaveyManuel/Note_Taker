## Description

In this project, I created a simple note taking application that uses express.js to help run the server. With my note taking application, the user is given the chance to write in a text area and for their note. The note takes in a title, and text, and once the note is saved, it is then shown on the left side of the page. Among other features include creating a new note and deleting a specific note based on its ID.

## Usage
 
To use, click on 'New Title' and create a title for your note. Below the title is also the option to create an accompanying text. Once the note is created the user will be able to save the note and it will appear to the left side of the screen. If the user needs to delete a certain note, they will be able to click on the trash can icon and delete the specified note. 

## UserStory

As a user, I want to use a note taking app so that it records inputted text when I type into the specified text area.


## Motivation

The motivation for my project was to create a note taking application that gives the user the ability to record notes and delete notes as desired.
